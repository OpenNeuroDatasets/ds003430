## Dataset

### MRI data

This dataset contains fMRI data from five subjects ('sub-01', 'sub-02', 'sub-03', 'sub-04', and 'sub-05'). The subjects performed eight sessions of fMRI experiments ('ses-01', 'ses-02', ..., 'ses-08').
Each scanning session consisted of functional (EPI) and anatomical (inplane T2) images.
The functional EPI images covered the entire brain (TR, 2000 ms; TE, 43 ms; flip angle, 80°; voxel size, 2 × 2 × 2 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm; number of slices, 76; slice gap, 0 mm; multiband factor, 4) and inplane T2-weighted anatomical images were acquired with the same slices used for the EPI (TR, 11,000 ms; TE, 59 ms; flip angle, 160°; voxel size, 0.75 × 0.75 × 2.0 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm).
The dataset also includes a T1-weighted anatomical reference image for each subject (TR, 2250 ms; TE, 3.06 ms; TI, 900 ms; flip angle, 9°; voxel size, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm; FOV, 256 × 256 mm).
The T1-weighted images were scanned only once for each subject in a separate scanning session and are stored in 'ses-anatomy' directories.
The T1-weighted images were defaced by pydeface (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydeface>).
All DICOM files are converted to Nifti-1 files by mri_convert in FreeSurfer.


### Task event files

Task event files ('sub-\*_ses-\*_task-CowenKeltnerEmotionMovie_run-\*_events.tsv') contains recorded event during fMRI runs. Each column of the task event files represents:

- 'onset': onset time of an event (sec)
- 'duration': duration of the event (sec)
- 'trial_type': type of the event (1: Stimulus presentation block, -1 and -2: Initial and post rest blocks without visual stimulus)
- 'stimulus_name': stimulus file name of the video presented in a stimulus block ('n/a' in rest blocks)
- 'stimulus_index': stimulus ID of the video presented in a stimulus block ('n/a' in rest blocks)
